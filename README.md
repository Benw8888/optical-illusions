# Designing Perceptual Puzzles by Differentiating Probabilistic Programs

This repository contains source code to accompany the SIGGRAPH paper [_Designing
Perceptual Puzzles by Differentiating Probabilistic Programs_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12301)
(Chandra, Li, Tenenbaum, and Ragan-Kelley 2022).

> We design new visual illusions by finding "adversarial examples" for
> principled models of human perception â€” specifically, for probabilistic
> models, which treat vision as Bayesian inference. To perform this search
> efficiently, we design a _differentiable_ probabilistic programming language,
> whose API exposes MCMC inference as a first-class differentiable function. We
> demonstrate our method by automatically creating illusions for three features
> of human vision: color constancy, size constancy, and face perception.
